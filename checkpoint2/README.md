# Checkpoint 2

## Background and Loading data
Our project requires old data that was provided to us by the Invisible Institute and Professor Rogers. Here are instructions for loading the data and creating the new `case_info_08282018` table:



## Questions
* Visualization of allegation data distribution by category and compare with different versions of allegation tables - i.e. find allegation category distribution from previous version and compare with the current version of cpdb database (density charts)
* Visual Chart (heatmap) that plots the incidence of allegation categories normalized by the # of reports associated with that area. (location-based)
* Codes and categories mapping, hopefully come up with good viz
* Interactive Chart (FIGURE OUT LATER)


## Answers
* The first thing to note is the change in the allegation category names from the old data to the new data (CPDB). In the old data, there were many more categories and commonly used ones were "MISCELLANOUS", "ARESTEE-DURING ARREST", and "UNECESSARY PHYSICAL CONTACT 0N-DUTY."
