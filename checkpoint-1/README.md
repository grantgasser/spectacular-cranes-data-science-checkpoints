# Checkpoint 1
* Our theme is looking at how allegations have been changed over time (e.g. The type of allegation being changed to something less serious)
  * This requires us to access data not currently available in CPDB

## Our Questions
1. What categories of allegations are changed the most?
2. Which investigators/administrators most often changed the category of allegation (e.g. “Sexual assault” => “Illegal Search and Seizure”)
3. What data attributes are changed the most? (e.g. category of the allegation, or officers involved, etc)
4. How do changes in the allegation type affect officer behavior? (e.g. If an officer’s allegations are being changed to a less severe type of allegation, are they more likely to continue receiving more complaints because they believe they can get away with it.)
